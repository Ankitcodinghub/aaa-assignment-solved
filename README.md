1 Introduction

The most famous AI challenge of the 20th century was to defeat humans in the game of chess. Beginning with Claude Shannonâ€™s paper in 1950,1 this goal was finally achieved in 1997, when IBMâ€™s Deep Blue defeated world champion Garry Kasparov. To honour this accomplishment, we will be developing an AI agent that plays the board game known as Congo. This document will outline exactly how the game works, what the assignment will consist of, and how marks will be allocated. More documents will be sent out at a later stage to expand on the requirements of Section 3.

2 The Game of Congo

Congo is a variant of chess that was invented in the 80s. It contains elements of chess, checkers and shogi (also known as Japanese chess), but the main philosophy is the same: to capture your opponentâ€™s most valuable piece. You can try out the game yourself here https://mindsports. nl/index.php/dagaz/882-congo and read more about it at https://mindsports.nl/index. php/the-pit/523-congo and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_(chess_variant). For ease of reference, we describe the rules below.

The game is played on a 7 Ã— 7 board. In the descriptions below, rows are called ranks and columns are called files. The start state looks as follows:

Figure 1: The starting position for White and Black. Initial positions: giraffes (a-file), monkeys (b-file), elephants (c- and e-files), lions (d-file), crocodiles (f-file), and zebras (g-file). Pawns fill each playerâ€™s second rank. Each playerâ€™s castles are highlighted in brown, and the river along the fourth rank is in blue.

Game dynamics

Congo consists of two players, Black and White, who take turns moving (no skipping of turns is allowed). White starts first. The aim of the game is to capture the opponentâ€™s lionâ€”the game is immediately over when one playerâ€™s lion has been captured. Players take turns making moves and potentially capturing their opponentâ€™s pieces. If a player moves to a square that is occupied by an opposing piece, that piece is said to be captured and is removed from the board. In Congo, as in chess, a player is not allowed to capture their own pieces, so moving to a square occupied by oneâ€™s own piece is prohibited.

Pieces

Each side begins with a number of pieces of various types. These pieces are:

Lion: The lion moves and captures one square in any direction (including diagonally), but it may not leave its 3 Ã— 3 castle (highlighted in brown in the diagrams). However, there is one exception to this rule: a lion is allowed to move in a straight or diagonal line across the river if it is able to immediately capture the opposing lion. If a playerâ€™s lion is captured, that player immediately loses the game. The diagram below shows the moves the white lion is able to make.

(b) Compared to the position on the left, the White lion on c3 can now also move across the river to capture the Black lion on e5 and win the game (red arrow)! The White lion could also potentially capture Blackâ€™s lion anywhere along the c-file.

Zebra: If you are familiar with chess, the zebra moves exactly as the chess knight. That is, it moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). The zebra can jump over pieces to reach its destination.

Elephant: The elephant can move or capture one or two squares horizontally or vertically in any direction. If it moves two squares, this move is a jump. Therefore, if there is any piece in the way, it does not block the elephant from moving two squares.

Monkey: The monkey can move one step in any direction (orthogonally or diagonally), but cannot make a capture this way. It can also capture an opposing piece on an adjacent square (orthogonally or diagonally) by jumping over it to the vacant square immediately beyond (if the square is not empty, the capture cannot be made). If a capture is made, then multiple captures are permitted (but are not compulsory) with the same piece in the same turn! In a multi-capture move: a) successive jumps can be in different directions; b) a given piece may be jumped only once; c) a given square may be visited more than once; d) all pieces jumped are removed from play only after the entire multi-capture move has been completed.

Pawn: A pawn can move and capture one step straight or diagonally forward. (Black pawns move forward towards rank 1, while White pawns move forward towards the rank 7.) When past the river, it can move (but not capture) one or two steps straight backwards. However, this is not a jumping move, and so the pawn may not move backwards if there is a piece in its path.

If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is promoted to a superpawn. A superpawn has the abilities of a regular pawn, but can additionally move and capture one square sideways. It may now retreat one or two squares straight or diagonally backwards, and this ability no longer depends on its position with regard to the river. However, just like the regular pawn, it may not capture or jump over a piece when retreating.

The River: As you saw in the initial setup, the board has a river running across the middle of it! Any piece may move into the river, but if that piece does not leave the river on its next turn, it is said to have drowned. The piece may not have moved at all, or may have moved within the river, or even, in the monkeyâ€™s case, out of and back into the river. In all cases, the piece is removed from the board. The only piece this does not apply to is the crocodile, which cannot drown and can stay in the river forever!

3 Groups and Grading

You may complete this assignment either individually or in groups of two. This assignment will

consist of a number of components, some of which contain a competitive element.

As we have seen in the previous labs on search, in order to create the AI agent we must develop two components: the problem dynamics and the search algorithm itself. The roadmap for how this assignment will be graded is as follows:

3.1 Successor Function (30/100)

The first part of the assignment will require you to implement the successor function (and hence the rules of the game). The successor function will inform the agent at a given state: a) what actions are available (i.e. the legal moves), and b) the next state that occurs when a move is executed. We will also need to implement functions that convert the current state to a string

representation, and also accept a string representation and set up the board accordingly. For this we will be using Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth% E2%80%93Edwards_Notation). Successfully creating a working implementation of the game will constitute 30% of the overall mark.

3.2 Minimax (20/100)

Having implemented the game dynamics, the next step will be to implement the adversarial search procedure. In particular, we will need to implement Minimax search. This will form a reasonably strong AI capable of playing the game! Successfully creating a working implemen- tation of a Minimax agent will constitute 20% of the overall mark.

3.3 Improvements (30/100)

Given the base Minimax algorithm, the next step is to add a number of improvements. If you are tackling this assignment individually, you will need to implement at least two improvements. However, if you have partnered up, then you must implement at least four. A list of potential improvements that may be included is provided below. You are welcome to implement other changes or ideas outside of these, but please contact myself or a tutor before doing so. We have not covered most of these, so implementing them will require some research on your part.

In order to determine the effect of these improvements, you will need to submit a mini research report that describes the techniques that were used, and run a number of experiments to quantify how much each change improved the AI over and above the baseline minimax algorithm. These improvements could be in terms of performance (i.e. the agent plays better) or in terms of speed (e.g. given a fixed time budget, the agent is able to search deeper). A rubric detailing how this report is to be compiled will be made available later. The report will constitute 30% of the overall mark.

3.4 Competitive Elements (20/100)

One important component of a strong game-playing agent is the ability to generate the game tree as fast as possible. 10% of the mark will be based on how many nodes your agent can generate per second. An exact breakdown of this portion will be provided in due course.

The final 10% of the mark will depend on how strong your program is compared to other submissions from the class. Everyoneâ€™s agent will play against one another in a round-robin tournament, and marks will be allocated based on overall final rankings.
